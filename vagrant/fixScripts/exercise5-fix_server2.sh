#in order to connect without password we first need to locate the current key that is created by vagrant

#after vagrant is up, we can locate the config for vagrant with 

#vagrant ssh-config

#identify the location of the Identity File

#and use the private key in order to ssh with hostKeyChecking disabled

sudo cat /vagrant/.vagrant/machines/server1/virtualbox/private_key

#server 1 is set up before server 2 so..


# since we cannot ssh to a non existent server yet the connection string will be commented out
